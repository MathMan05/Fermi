This is for in the future when I want to compress more images or anyone else for that matter.

PNGs:

        good at reducing the pallet, a first step for images that have a limited number of colors, bad at actually compressing things though
    pngcrush
        Good, but should be ran before optipng, but isn't as good as it, use in tandom
    optipng
        The best tool to really shrink pngs to be as small as they can be.

SVGs:

        great tool, if anyone knows how to squish them further, let me know, some manual work may go a long way to help shrink svgs, though I'm not doing that right now lol.

I may look into other formats soon as well, though these are the main two I'm currently using
