# Fermi
Fermi is a [Spacebar](https://spacebar.chat) Client written in TS, HTML, and CSS.

![](src/webpage/home/SS1.webp)

To build it, clone the repo and run `npm install`, then `npm run build`
To run it, use `npm start`
or do the equivalent with bun

Both [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) are supported, and should function as expected.

To access Fermi after starting, simply go to http://localhost:8080/login and either register a new account, or log in with your email and password.

If there are any issues please report them either here, or to me dirrectly on spacebar

## AI Code
AI code due to not being GPLv3 compatable is not allowed in this repo. I thought this didn't need to be said, but it does.
