# Code of conduct
It's nothing complicated, I want to foster a nice community, if there's any issues feel free to contact me in any way you see fit, though please don't create problems for me, I'm just one person and I want to work on this project, not community management. I will likely start with a warning or two if any issues arrise, though this is up to my(mathium05) sole discretion.
generally follow https://docs.spacebar.chat/contributing/conduct/ and you should be fine. Do not try to pull technicalities, this is a FOSS project, not a court of law.

Happy coding!
